The 2 deaths in the nivo+ipi arm were previously reported and described in the interim CSR; there were no additional deaths due to study drug toxicity reported in the nivo+ipi arm. b The verbatim terms reported for the ;other; reasons for death were consistent with events anticipated in the study population. None were considered related to study drug (per the investigator). c Discontinuation of any drug in the regimen. d No OESIs were reported in the following categories: demyelination, Guillain-Barre syndrome, graft vs host disease, autoimmune eye disorder, and immune mediated arthritis. MedDRA version 27.0; CTC version 5.0. All events are within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, unless otherwise indicated Source: Table 14.3.2.3.17.1, Table 14.3.2.1.1.1 (death summary), Appendix 16.2.7.4.1 (death listing)"
